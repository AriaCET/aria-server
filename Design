Dhananjay Balan.

 - Flow code.

 Main -> Configuration page with two options. 1. manage clients 2. Manage channels.
 Client manager -> add phone, delete phone.
 Channel Manager -> delete channel, add channels.

 - main screen asks authentication.
 - Each page provides an update key which does the actual config updates.

 BACKEND:
 	The changes are first written to a backend. update() syncs them with configuraton files.
