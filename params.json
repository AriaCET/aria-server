It uses the Asterisk Telephony server at the back and uses SIP/RTP protocols for data transfer.\r\n \r\n## Setting up the system.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/dhananjaynav/aria-server.git\r\n$ cd src\r\n$ ./install.py #sets up the password. Single time.\r\n$ ./main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nARIA server doesn't do any magic of itself. It is simply an abstraction of the asterisk paging system so that users can manage it without messing with the asterisk configuration scripts.\r\n\r\nCreated for [College Of Engineering, Trivandrum](http://cet.ac.in), With financial assistance from [Centre for Engineering Research and Development](http://cerd.cet.ac.in/).
